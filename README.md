# NHL Stats API Wrapper

The aim of this project is to build a Python wrapper module for the various public NHL APIs and data sources. 

## nhl_api

The first module here is *nhl_api* which is a module built to connect to the two public facing NHL APIs. The endpoint documentation is based on [NHL-API-Reference](https://github.com/Zmalski/NHL-API-Reference) by Zmalski.

There are two classes (Web and Stats), each with unique calls inside. It is highly recommended that you reference Zmalski's work to understand what each call is doing, but there are docstrings for each function in the classes.
